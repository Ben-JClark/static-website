                <h2>What is a URL?</h2>
                <p>
                    URLs are a type of URI. A URI is a Uniform Reousrce Identifier which is a line of text<br> 
                    that identifies an online resource like a web page. A URL is used for identifying but<br>
                    also retrieving online resources. Below an image of Facebook&apos;s URL with the HTTPS<br> 
                    protocol at the start.

                <h2>What is a Protocol?</h2>
                <p>
                    A protocol defines the communication mechanism to retrieve the resource such as a webpage.<br> 
                    The communication would consist of messages being sent back and forth between a server and<br>
                    a client. The mechanism would be how the client and server would handle the messages.
                </p>
                <h2>What does HTTP and HTTPS stand for?</h2>
                <p>
                    HTTP stands for "Hyper Text Transfer Protocol" and HTTPS stands for the same thing, but the<br>
                    “S” stands for "Secure". The term “Hyper Text” is used to refer to a document that contains<br>
                    hyperlinks to navigate around it, this is also what a website is.
                </p>
                <h2>HTTP vs HTTPS</h2>
                <p>
                    HTTPS uses encryption and validation techniques when the server and client are communicating.<br>
                    The most popular way it does this does this by obtaining a Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate.<br>
                    <span class="link">
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">Click here</a>
                    </span>
                     for more information about TLS certificates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HTTP does not use encryption when transmitting data, therefor it is visible  to anyone monitoring<br>
                    the connection. Almost all web pages use HTTPS, the ones that use HTTP are public webpages that<br>
                    contain no sensitive information. If your using chrome, you will see a Not Secure statement before<br>
                    the URL if the website is using HTTP. You should avoid entering any sensitive information if you<br>
                    see that statement. An example is shown below.

                <h2>The Client and Server</h2>
                <p>
                    For our purposes a client is a web browser running on a device. This can be a windows laptop running<br>
                     google chrome. A Server is the device from where the pages being browsed are stored. This could be<br>
                     a windows laptop, but most likely is a desktop computer designed to store and process lots of data,<br>
                     the computer may also be running Linux instead of windows. HTTP or HTTPS is the method of communication<br>
                     between the client and the server.
                </p>
