                <p>
                    Before we said that a GET request method is usually used to get read only data, this would<br>
                    be done without modifying the server. We then said a POST request method is used when we<br>
                    want to modify a server. We can also put these request methods into categories to better<br>
                    understand which one we should use.
                </p>
                <h2>Safe methods</h2>
                <p>
                    They are the methods that are intended for information retrieval only. They are GET, HEAD,<br> 
                    OPTIONS and TRACE. 
                </p>          
                <h2>Side effect methods</h2>
                <p>
                    These methods have side effects on the server and can modify files and send emails.<br> 
                    These methods are POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH. 
                </p>
                <h2>Idempotent methods</h2>
                <p>
                    Are methods that can be called multiple times with identical requests with only the first<br>
                    successful one making an effect. These methods are PUT, DELETE, and all the safe methods.<br>
                    POST can be idempotent depending on what it does. Below is an example of when you would<br>
                    want to use an idempotent POST method.

                <p>
                    This is an example of a common sign-up form. If a client continuously clicked submit,<br>
                    then the server should only receive the first successful POST request method. Therefor<br>
                    this POST method would be idempotent. If the POST method was not configured to be<br>
                    idempotent, then the server would receive multiple forms which could cause an issue.<br>
                    I have also implemented a form below so you can try clicking submit multiple times.
